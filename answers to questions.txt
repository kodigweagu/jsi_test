Question 1 - Briefly describe how you would approach designing and implementing a database to store your 
model.
Answer - 
I would use a key-value store because the data has no predefined schema. 
Each data type would be a key, and the value would store all records with their full payload, mirroring the current in-memory repository structure.

Question 2 - Describe an authentication strategy that could be added to the TimeFilter endpoint
Answer - 
I would secure the TimeFilter endpoint using JWT-based authentication. 
Clients include a signed JWT in the Authorization header, which is validated on each request to verify identity, expiry, and permissions before allowing access to the endpoint.

Question 3 - Briefly describe a strategy for creating a CI-CD pipeline for the API created in earlier tasks.
Answer - 
I would use Jenkins to run CI-CD pipelines that execute automated tests and coverage checks for every PR. 
Successful builds would produce a deployable artifact, such as a Docker image. 
Jenkins would also deploy the same artifact to staging and production using environment-based configuration.


## API Endpoints
GET - /GetTypes
POST - /TimeFilter

We do not know what the data might look like other than that there is a 'DateTime' field that represents the time the communication was recorded.
This request format was chosen because we know that those fields are required to make a proper TimeFilter request. If any of those fields are wrong, we get back a 400 HTTP response.

Example Request body with datetimes in ISO format- 
{
  "DataTypes": ["Chats", "Emails"],
  "FromTime": "2021-01-01",
  "ToTime": "2021-01-03"
}

Example Response - 
[
    {
        "Application": "Facebook",
        "From": "john@yahoo.com",
        "To": "Susan Smith",
        "DateTime": "1-1-2021 9:00",
        "Text": "Hi did you call me earlier?",
        "communicationType": "Chats"
    }
]

Other improvements:

I assumed we will always parse a pipe delimited CSV file. We need an interface to abstract the data parsing.
There is also an assumption thet the DateTime is in the right format.
